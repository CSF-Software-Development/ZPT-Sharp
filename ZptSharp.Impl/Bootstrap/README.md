The files in this directory/namespace are all used in only one place:
`ZptSharp.ServiceCollectionExtensions.AddZptSharp(IServiceCollection serviceCollection)`.

They exist only to organise the service collection/DI registrations, they have no other logic.

The entry point to this logic is `ZptSharpCoreServiceRegistrations`.
