# ZPT-Sharp
ZPT-Sharp is an implementation of [Zope Page Templates] in .NET.
Its main use case is as `ViewEngine` for **ASP.NET MVC** (presently, only MVC version 5 is supported).
It also provides offline page-rendering via the **ZptBuilder.exe** command-line utility.

## Current status
The current status of the project - as of `v0.7.0` - is that the software should be considered in an _alpha_ state.
There are presently no open issues with [the API Change label], although I am currently considering ([for csharp expressions] and [for python expressions]) how to permit importing of other code, referencing assemblies and making Linq available.  This could potentially impact upon the stability of the API.

I would certainly not recommend the project for production use yet.
At this stage I would welcome exploration, testing and (most importantly) bug-reports from interested parties.
