ZPT-Sharp
=========

Implementation of Zope Page Templates (ZPT) in C#, for use as a .NET MVC v2 ViewEngine

The current state of this project is that it requires a rewrite from scratch.  Whilst
parts worked in the original version, there were some serious deficiencies which must be
addressed.  This rewrite is on hold.  I do not suggest trying to use the previous version,
as it contains 'showstopper' bugs.
