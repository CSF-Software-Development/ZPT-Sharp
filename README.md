# ZPT-Sharp
ZPT-Sharp is an implementation of [Zope Page Templates] in .NET.
Its main use case is as `ViewEngine` for **ASP.NET MVC** (presently, only MVC version 5 is supported).
It also provides offline page-rendering via the **ZptBuilder.exe** command-line utility.

## Current status
The current status of the project - as of `v0.6.1` - is that the software should be considered in an _alpha_ state.
Whilst there are now no issues open with the **API Change** label, I still cannot promise that the API is completely stable.
I would certainly not recommend it for production use.
At this stage I would welcome exploration, testing and (most importantly) bug-reports from interested parties.
