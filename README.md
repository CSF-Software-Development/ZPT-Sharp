ZPT-Sharp
=========

Implementation of Zope Page Templates (ZPT) in C#,
intended for eventual use as an ASP.NET MVC ViewEngine

The current state of this project is that it is undergoing a rewrite from scratch.  Whilst
parts worked in the original version, there were some serious deficiencies which must be
addressed.  I do not suggest trying to use that previous version, as it contains
some serious showstopper bugs which are all-but unfixable within the architecture in which
it was designed.
