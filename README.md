# ZPT-Sharp
ZPT-Sharp is an implementation of Zope Page Templates (ZPT) in C♯ and .NET.
Its main use case is as `ViewEngine` for ASP.NET MVC (currently only MVC5 supported).
It also provides offline page-rendering via the **ZptBuilder** command-line utility.

## More information
In-depth documentation is available [at the project website](http://csf-dev.github.io/ZPT-Sharp/).

## Current status
The current status of the project - as of `v0.5.0` - is a tentative alpha.
I cannot currently promise that the API will not change, and I would certainly not recommend it for production use.
At this stage I would welcome exploration, testing and (most importantly) bug-reports from interested parties.
