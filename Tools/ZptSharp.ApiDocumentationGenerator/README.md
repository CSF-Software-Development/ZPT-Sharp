# API documentation
This project directory is *not a direct part of ZptSharp*.  It is home to
a [DocFx API documentation generation] project.  This is used to generate
an API documentation website from the source code and documentation comments
in that source code.  This generation occurs automatically; it is a part of
the overall build process for the solution, triggered by `dotnet build`.
