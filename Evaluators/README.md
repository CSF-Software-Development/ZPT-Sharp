Each project in this directory is a different ZptSharp **expression evaluator**. Expression evaluators extend the TALES syntax, enabling additional types of expressions. Each expression evaluator is a class which implements `ZptSharp.Expressions.IEvaluatesExpression`.

Expression evaluators are resolved from dependency injection and are registered for use with `ZptSharp.Expressions.IRegistersExpressionEvaluator`.
