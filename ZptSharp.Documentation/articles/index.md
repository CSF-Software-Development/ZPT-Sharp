# ZptSharp documentation

## Get started

Those who are new to ZptSharp are recommended to follow one of four short **quick start** guides. These guides each take the developer through a 'hello world' example, giving them a working sample app using ZptSharp. You may also wish to read [a conceptual summary] of what ZptSharp is.

* [Quick start for ASP.NET Core MVC]
* [Quick start for ASP.NET MVC 5]
* [Quick start for consuming the API]
* [Quick start for the command line renderer]

An ideal follow-up to using a quick start guide is to follow [the ZPT tutorial]. This expands upon what was learned during quick-start teaches the full range of ZptSharp functionality.
