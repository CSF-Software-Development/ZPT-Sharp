# Logging ZptSharp operations

ZptSharp integrates with [the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging framework].
By default it is configured to use a null/no-operation logger.

When [configuring services in dependency injection], if you add a logger implementation then you may receive ZptSharp log messages.
Messages generated by ZptSharp are generally recorded at `Debug` and `Trace` levels.

## Example

Here is a very simple example which activates console logging with dependency injection.
As you can see, the addition of logging is not linked intrinsically to ZptSharp itself.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console;
using ZptSharp;

serviceCollection
    .AddZptSharp()
    .AddStandardZptExpressions()
    .AddHapZptDocuments();

serviceCollection
    .AddLogging(b => {
        b.ClearProviders();
        b.AddSimpleConsole(o => {
            o.ColorBehavior = LoggerColorBehavior.Disabled;
            o.IncludeScopes = true;
        });
        b.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);
    });
```
