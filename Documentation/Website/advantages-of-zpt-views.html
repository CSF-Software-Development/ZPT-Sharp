      </header>
      <p>
        ​Amongst the goals of the ZPT syntax is to make view pages useful to both developers and
        non-developers alike. A front-end designer (who perhaps knows only HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
        should be able to work with a ZPT source file without need for extra tools, and with
        minimal training.
      </p>
      <h2>Simple syntax</h2>
      <p>
        ​​ZPT intentionally defines a very limited syntax. This is organised into three core categories
        and is designed to be intuitive to designers:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>METAL</dt>
        <dd>
          <abbr title="Macro Expansion Template Attribute Language">METAL</abbr>
          brings together the source files which make up a page. Regions of reusable markup
          ('macros' in ZPT terminology) from various files are assembled into a single view, ready
          to be processed by TAL.
        </dd>
        <dt>TAL</dt>
        <dd>
          <abbr title="Template Attribute Language">TAL</abbr>
          modifies the assembled view, inserting data values, conditionally rendering/omitting
          areas of markup and repeating sections of markup for items in a collection. In essence
          TAL binds data from the model to the view.
        </dd>
        <dt>TALES</dt>
        <dd>
          <abbr title="Template Attribute Language Expression Syntax">TALES</abbr>
          is an expression syntax used by METAL and TAL to reference values from the model.
          The recommended/default `path` expression type uses a syntax which looks much like a
          relative URL for traversing object graphs to values, which should be familiar to designers
          and developers alike.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>Source files are valid (X)HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Because ZPT is an attribute language, it does not require you to 'break' the structure of
        your HTML (or XML/XHTML, as applicable) to insert processing directives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider ASP.NET pages (with or without the use of Razor). These template languages frequently
        require you to insert directives which are not valid within the structure of an HTML page.
        Once this has happened, the page may only be rendered usefully using your server-side application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the ZPT syntax, the source files remain valid HTML; such a file may be viewed offline
        (without the the web application or a ZPT renderer).
        Of course when viewing the page offline in a browser, the ZPT directives will not be processed
        but the structure of the page and the static content will remain valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The payoff is the ability to share ZPT source files with HTML/CSS front-end designers.
        They may use these offline from the web application in order to perform their work without the need
        to be able to build/run the .NET application which provides the model.
        They may edit these source files using whatever tools they wish and see the results of their work
        immediately.
        What they see in their offline browsers/editing tools is structurally the same as what the
        real application will display.
      </p>
      <h3>Sample content in source files</h3>
      <p>
        Linked with the above, another benefit is that is possible to bake sample content into a source
        page.
        This is again useful to designers; when editing/viewing a page offline from the application, the
        sample content provides an example of what the application/ZPT renderer might create.
        When the ZPT renderer actually renders the source, then this sample (aka "default") content is
        excluded/replaced by the METAL/TAL directives.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is possible because many of ZPT's directives replace sections of markup or text with data
        from the application.
        Consider the following example:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;div class=&quot;user_info&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You are logged in as
    &lt;strong tal:content=&quot;here/CurrentUser/Name&quot;&gt;Joseph Bloggs&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
        Viewing this source code offline in a web browser will show the sample name
        <strong>Joseph Bloggs</strong>; the browser will ignore the
        <a href="tal/content-replace.html"><code>tal:content</code></a> attribute which it does not
        understand.  When put through a ZPT renderer though, the content directive will cause the applicable
        value from the model to be placed in this position instead.  The sample content will not be included
        in the rendered output.
      </p>
      <h2>ZPT enforces best-practice</h2>
      <p>
        A <em>bad code smell</em> in ASP.NET views, is to see sections of .NET application code inside the
        view source files. These are more than just expressions to access values from the model; they are
        control-flow logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        ZPT's intentionally-limited syntax puts up quite a lot of resistance to this. It offers no way to
        readily break-out of the mark-up syntax and into .NET application logic. Thus, functionality which might
        creep into the views is pushed toward the MVC controllers or models - where it should be.
