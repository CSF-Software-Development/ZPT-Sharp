ZPT Sharp, an implementation of Zope Page Templates in C#,
as a .NET MVC v2 ViewEngine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly - THIS SOFTWARE IS DISTRIBUTED FREE OF CHARGE WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF
ANY SORT.  Please see the attached license document (LICENCE).  The current
state of this project is a 'tentative alpha' release.  That means that it might
not work, that it might destroy your data, ruin your country's economy and kick
your neighbours puppy.  Certainly don't use this for anything mission-critical!

Secondly, a quick nod to https://github.com/lck/SharpTAL - it seems that the
two of us developed our implementations in parallel and I only found out about
SharpTAL once I had nearly finished my own.  SharpTAL was made public first.

At some point I need to write a more thorough introduction and README for this
project but for now, assuming you know how to use the ASP.NET MVC v2, compile
the Parser project and then take a look at the SampleMvcSite project for how
to integrate ZPT into your MVC project as a custom ViewEngine.

As the first paragraph notes, this is very new software and it hasn't yet been
used 'in the wild'.  It could be riddled with bugs and security issues.  That
said, I would love if some hobbyists and/or those with non-mission-critical
projects would use this, to give some testing in small-scale production
environments.  I'm certainly planning on switching my personal website over
to using it.

Enjoy!
