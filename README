ZPT Sharp, an implementation of Zope Page Templates in C#,
as a .NET MVC v2 ViewEngine

Firstly - THIS SOFTWARE IS DISTRIBUTED FREE OF CHARGE WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF
ANY SORT.  Please see the attached license document (LICENCE).  The current
state of this project is a 'tentative alpha 2' release.  That means that it might
not work, that it might destroy your data, ruin your country's economy and kick
your neighbours puppy.  Certainly don't use this for anything mission-critical!

Secondly, a quick nod to https://github.com/lck/SharpTAL - it seems that the
two of us developed our implementations in parallel and I only found out about
SharpTAL once I had nearly finished my own.  SharpTAL was made public first.

As of 16th September 2011, the auto-generated API documentation (created using
DoxyGen) has been moved to http://csf-software-development.github.com/ZPT-Sharp/api-doxygen/

http://csf-software-development.github.com/ZPT-Sharp/ contains some initial work on the
documentation website for this project (see github issue #11).  It is in a very
early state and nowhere near complete but I feel that /some/ documentation is
better than /no/ documentation.  I will be adding to it as time goes by.

To get using ZPT-Sharp right now alongside ASP.NET MVC v2, compile the project
CraigFowler.Web.ZPT and copy the DLL into your bin/ directory.  Then take a
look at http://csf-software-development.github.com/ZPT-Sharp/quickstart-mvc.html and also
the CraigFowler.Web.ZPT.Mvc.Samples project for how to get started.

As the first paragraph notes, this is very new software and it hasn't yet been
used 'in the wild'.  It could be riddled with bugs and security issues.  That
said, I would love if some hobbyists and/or those with non-mission-critical
projects would use this, to give some testing in small-scale production
environments.  As far as I am concerned, enough of the required features have been
completed that this project is erady for my own use in development projects.

I would like to perform some serious refactoring and tidy-up though before I
declare this project "beta 1".

Enjoy!
