ZPT Sharp, an implementation of Zope Page Templates in C#,
as a .NET MVC v2 ViewEngine

** IMPORTANT NOTE **
I have discovered some serious showstopper issues with architecture of this
project that make it completely unsuitable for use in production environments.
It is likely that the project will go through at least a partial rewrite before
it is deemed suitable for any serious use.

THIS SOFTWARE IS DISTRIBUTED FREE OF CHARGE WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF
ANY SORT.  Please see the attached license document (LICENCE).  The current
state of this project is a 'tentative alpha 2' release.  That means that it might
not work, that it might destroy your data, ruin your country's economy and kick
your neighbours puppy.  Certainly don't use this for anything mission-critical!

I would like to take this opportunity to make a quick nod to
https://github.com/lck/SharpTAL - it seems that the two of us developed our
implementations in parallel and I only found out about SharpTAL once I had nearly
finished my own.  SharpTAL was made public first.

As of 16th September 2011, the auto-generated API documentation (created using
DoxyGen) has been moved to http://csf-software-development.github.com/ZPT-Sharp/api-doxygen/

http://csf-software-development.github.com/ZPT-Sharp/ contains some initial work on the
documentation website for this project (see github issue #11).  It is in a very
early state and nowhere near complete but I feel that /some/ documentation is
better than /no/ documentation.  I will be adding to it as time goes by.

To get using ZPT-Sharp right now alongside ASP.NET MVC v2, compile the project
CraigFowler.Web.ZPT and copy the DLL into your bin/ directory.  Then take a
look at http://csf-software-development.github.com/ZPT-Sharp/quickstart-mvc.html and also
the CraigFowler.Web.ZPT.Mvc.Samples project for how to get started.

Enjoy!
