This project is a very simple way (but time-saving) way of dealing with
parameters and arguments for command-line-interface (CLI) applications.

I quite often find myself having to write applications of this sort; often I
will want to script a process that performs some logic that is just too involved
for shell-scripting to be of use.  Also (when creating web applications) I will
often want a small application, that I can call using a task-scheduler such as
cron, that can act as an alternative UI layer to my domain model logic.

Parsing commandline parameters would appear to be a simple task but once there
are more than just one or two parameters available it becomes repetitive and
tiresome to parse them in a flexible and sane manner.  The long-term goal of
this is to provide a flexible API that handles this and exposes strongly-named
objects that the main application API can make use of.
