# ZPT-Sharp
ZPT-Sharp is an implementation of [Zope Page Templates] for .NET.
It is primarily intended for use as as a `ViewEngine` for **ASP.NET MVC** v5.
It also provides offline page-rendering via the **ZptBuilder.exe** command-line utility, as well
as exposing **a page-rendering API** for your own applications.
