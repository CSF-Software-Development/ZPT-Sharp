    <!--    Exception classes do not need code coverage,
            their constructor signatures are boilerplate and
            it is fine if they are not covered by tests.
    
            Also, there's no need to cover any code in the Examples directory.
            This isn't actually a part of the library.
    
            The ZptSharpViewEngine for MVC5 is unfortuately untestable (due to
            framework limitations).  I am not counting this class toward the
            coverage totals.
