        <h1>TALES 'path' expressions</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        TALES <code>path:</code> expressions are the lifeblood of TALES, and are the default expression type where
        no <a href="tales/introduction.html#expression_prefixes">expression prefix</a> has been provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Path expressions indicate a traversal through an object model - the current <em>TALES context</em>.  This
        context includes a set of <a href="tales/built-in-variables.html">built in variables</a> as well as any other
        variables added by either the environment or by
        <a href="tal/define.html">TAL <code>define</code></a>/<a href="tal/repeat.html">TAL <code>repeat</code></a>
        attributes.
      </p>
      <h2>Structure of a path expression</h2>
      <p>
        Each expression must begin with a variable name, and may traverse the members which that variable exposes via
        forward-slashes: <kbd>/</kbd>.  
      </p>
      <h2>Providing multiple paths</h2>
      <p>
        It is possible to provide multiple TALES paths within a single expression, separated by the pipe/vertical bar
        character: <kbd>|</kbd> and optionally whitespace.  For example the following is a legal path expression:
        <code>Model/Foo/Bar | Model/Alternative/Path | backupValue</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When evaluating such a path expression, an attempt is made to
        <a href="tales/path-expressions.html#object_traversal">traverse each path</a> starting with the first.
        If a path is traversed successfully then the result from that path is returned as the result of the path
        expression and no further paths are traversed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a path cannot be traversed - for example, an exception such as a <code>NullReferenceException</code>
        is raised during traversal - then traversal of that path ceases and an attempt is made to traverse the next
        path in the expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a path within the expression yields a result then further paths are not used.  If, alternatively, none
        of the paths in an expression yield a result then an evaluation error is raised.  Thus, providing multiple paths
        within a single expression is a useful as a manner of guarding against errors, or providing fall-back values.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the following example. If the current user were <code>null</code> then, instead of raising an error
        when displaying the user's name, some fallback text would be displayed.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;p tal:define=&quot;unknownUser string:an unknown user;
               currentUser Model/CurrentUser&quot;&gt;
  You are logged in as
  &lt;span tal:content=&quot;currentUser/Name | unknownUser&quot;&gt;Joseph Bloggs&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
      <h2 id="object_traversal">Path traversal</h2>
      <p>
        The precise meaning of traversal through a path is as follows.  The path to traverse is separated
        into fragments - individual pieces of the path, as separated by slashes.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, the starting point of the traversal is retrieved from the current TALES context, using the first path
          fragment.  This value becomes "the current object to be traversed".
        </li>
        <li>
          The next path fragment (if there is one) is used for traversal using the rules below.
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the traversal is a failure (either an exception is raised, or a traversal rule indicates failure)
              then the evaluation of the current path stops.  If there are more paths in the expression then traversal
              begins again with the next path.  If there are no more paths, then the evaluation of the path expression
              is a failure and a TALES Exception is raised.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the traversal is not a failure then it is considered a success.  The result of the traversal is stored
              as "the current object to be traversed" and the traversal continues.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are no more path fragments in the current path, then "the current object to be traversed" is returned
          as the result of the path expression.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are more path fragments in the current path then the process returns to step 2, using the
          new "current object to be traversed".
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Traversing a path fragment</h3>
      <p>
        The rules for traversing each path fragment are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the current object to be traversed implements <code>CSF.Zpt.Tales.ITalesPathHandler</code> then its
          <code>HandleTalesPath(string, out object, RenderingContext)</code> method is called, using the path
          fragment as the first parameter.  The <code>System.Boolean</code> return of the method is used to determine
          whether traversal was a success or not.  In the case of a success, the <code>System.Object</code> exposed
          via the second parameter is used as the result of the traversal.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the current object to be traversed has an indexer of type <code>System.String</code> then that indexer
          is used.  The path fragment (as a string literal) is used as a parameter for that indexer.  The return value
          from the indexer is used as the result of the traversal.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the current object to be traversed has a method, taking no parameters, matching the name of the path
          fragment, than that method is executed.  Its return value is used as the result of the traversal.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the current object to be traversed has a gettable property, matching the name of the path
          fragment, than that property getter is invoked.  Its value is used as the result of the traversal.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the current object to be traversed has a field, matching the name of the path
          fragment, than the value is retrieved from that field.  This is used as the result of the traversal.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the current object to be traversed has an indexer of type <code>System.Int32</code> then that indexer
          is used.  The path fragment is parsed as an integer and used as a parameter for that indexer.  The return
          value from the indexer is used as the result of the traversal.
        </li>
        <li>
          If none of the above are true, then the traversal is unsuccessful.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Interpolated path fragments</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="tales/path-expressions.html#object_traversal">When traversing a path</a>, a path fragment may optionally
        be prefixed with a question mark symbol: <kbd>?</kbd>.  This signifies that the path fragment is
        <strong>interpolated</strong> by evaluating the name of that fragment as a single variable reference from the TALES
        context.  The result of that evaluation is converted to a <code>System.String</code> and used as the text of
        the fragment for continuing traversal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only single variables may be evaluated in this manner, so interpolated path fragments do not trigger traversal
        themselves.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        The example below shows a sample list of filenames uploaded by the current user.  However, in this case, the
        list of uploaded files is not available as a property of the 'CurrentUser' object, rather as a property of a
        'SharedUploads' object, using the user-name as a key.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user-name is stored within the variable <code>userName</code> via the
        <a href="tal/define.html"><code>tal:define</code> attribute</a>, and then referenced as an interpolated path
        fragment within the expression used in the <a href="tal/repeat.html"><code>tal:repeat</code> attribute</a>.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;ul tal:define=&quot;userName Model/CurrentUser/Name&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li tal:repeat=&quot;file Model/SharedUploads/?userName/Files&quot;
      tal:content=&quot;file/Name&quot;&gt;Sample filename&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
