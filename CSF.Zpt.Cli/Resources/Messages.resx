ZPT-Sharp Page Builder
----------------------

Usage:  ZptBuilder.exe [options] [inputs]

If inputs are omitted or are "-" then the application reads from standard input.  Where
inputs are provided in the commandline, they may be one or more of file and/or directory
paths.  File paths cause the single file to be rendered, wheras directory paths trigger
a search for input files.

In the case where the input contains one or more directories, where the --output option is
also used and set to a directory, each rendered file is written to a path within the output
directory relative to its path within the input directory.  For example:

  ZptBuilder.exe --output "output/" "dir/input/"

The output might be as such (assuming the following files contained in the input
directory):

  Input files                 Output paths
  -----------                 ------------
  dir/input/foo.pt            output/foo.html
  dir/input/bar.pt            output/bar.html
  dir/input/sub/sub-foo.pt    output/sub/sub-foo.html

Supported options
-----------------

  --help, -h                            Print this usage statement and exit.

  --html, -t                            Operate in HTML mode, input and output are
                                        treated as HTML, regardless of file extension.
  
  --xml, -x                             Operate in XML mode, input and output are treated
                                        as XML, regardless of file extension.
  
  --annotate                            Enable source annotation in output; comments will
                                        be added indicating points at which elements are
                                        imported from other files.
                      
  --no-xml-declaration                  Omit the &lt;?xml?&gt; declaration in output
                                        files.  Only applicable when the input/output is
                                        treated as XML.
                              
  --no-indent-xml                       Do not pretty-format XML output (by default output
                                        is indented for human readability).  Only
                                        applicable when the input/output is treated as
                                        XML.
                              
  --xml-indent-chars=CHARS              Sets the character string with which to indent XML
                                        output. By default this is two spaces: "  ".
                                        Only applicable when the input/output is treated
                                        as XML, and only if --no-indent-xml is not used.
                              
  --input-filename-pattern=PATTERN,     Sets the filename matching pattern for recognising
  -p PATTERN                            input files.  Only applicable for inputs which are
                                        directories and not files (or standard input).
                                        Files matching this shell pattern are selected for
                                        rendering, those which do not match are not.
  
  --output=LOCATION, -o LOCATION        Defines the output location.  If omitted then
                                        output is rendered to standard output.  If given
                                        as a filename then output is sent to the given
                                        file.  If given as a directory, a file will be
                                        created in this directory for each input file
                                        processed.
  
  --output-filename-extension=EXT,      Overrides the file extension for which to write
  -e EXT                                output files.  By default this is determined
                                        automatically based upon the processing mode (HTML
                                        or XML).
  
  --ignore=PATH, -i PATH                When any inputs are directories, the given paths
                                        are ignored when searching for files to process.
                                        Multiple paths may be separated by semicolon: ";"
                                        characters.
  
  --keyword-options=KEY_VALUE_PAIRS     Sets ZPT keyword options.  This is performed in
                                        the format "keyone=valueone;keytwo=valuetwo" etc.
  
  --rendering-context-factory=CLASS     Overrides the default implementation of
                                        CSF.Zpt.Rendering.IRenderingContextFactory
                                        to use when creating rendering contexts, by
                                        providing an assembly-qualified name of the class
                                        to use.
  
  --output-encoding=ENCODING,           Sets the output character encoding to use.  By
  -n ENCODING                           default the UTF-8 encoding is used.  Any encoding
                                        'web name' may be specified here.
  
  --context-visitors=CLASSES            Overrides the default implementations of
                                        CSF.Zpt.Rendering.IContextVisitor
                                        to use when rendering documents.  This is an
                                        ordered list of assembly-qualified names,
                                        separated by semicolons: ";".
